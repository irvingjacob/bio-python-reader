# bio-python-reader
Testing of using BioPython to read .pdb formatted files

Goal: read in .pdb files using biopython, convert to a format that can be used by fr3d-python to help fr3d python have functionality for .pdb files and .cif files. 

pdbConvertor.py right now just uses a parser to extract info from a pdb file 

PDB file must be located in root (bio-python-reader) directory as of right now to be read in.
